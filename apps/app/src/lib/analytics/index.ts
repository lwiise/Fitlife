// Product analytics — app-wide (authenticated routes AND the landing page).

// instrumented: it is a shared concern now, and an authenticated page importing
// @/marketing/lib/... would create a false dependency edge from app → marketing.
//
// posthog-js is ~50KB gz — far too heavy for the landing page's critical
// bundle. It is dynamic-imported after the page goes idle; events fired before
// it loads are queued (bounded) and flushed on load, so early CTA clicks are
// never lost.
//
// ANONYMOUS BY DESIGN: nothing here calls identify(), and posthog is configured
// with person_profiles: "identified_only", so no person profile is ever created.
// The device-level distinct_id still links signup → onboarding → pricing within
// a session, which is what the free-path-vs-paid question needs. Adding
// identify() would make this personally identifiable and require a privacy
// rewrite — don't, without that conversation.

  // DB row is left as-is.) Staleness is measured off updated_at: an actively-
  // progressing shell rewrites plan_data every day, so it stays fresh; only a
  // dead one goes stale. The rule — and, crucially, that a partial week is KEPT
  // rather than discarded — lives in resolveStaleness so it can be tested.
  //
  // Second, sharper question: did the worker ever acknowledge the invocation at
  // all? It stamps `worker_ack_at` into plan_data before any model call, so on a
  // 'generating' row the ABSENCE of any write means the run never started — the
  // state a rejected shared secret or a missing key produces, and one the
  // dispatcher cannot see because Netlify answers a background function with 202
  // before the handler runs. "Nothing ever wrote" is exactly "plan_data is still
  // the empty object createPlanRows inserted"; any key at all — the ACK, or a

/**
 * Phase 1 must leave room for phase 2.
 *
 * Production, 3-member household (Sentry bfda604f): the run spent 856s and
 * $0.46 and every one of the 7 days was deferred with "run budget spent before
 * this day started (no model call made)". `bigCallTimeoutMs` sizes the skeleton
 * call to the WORK (280s at 3 members, up to 600s) and knew nothing about the
 * 15-minute run deadline — and the truncation retry can run it a second time.
 * The result was an EMPTY plan marked failed, which then hid the complete week
 * the family already had.

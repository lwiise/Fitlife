/**
 * Continuation chaining — the decision half.
 *
 * A meal run that ends with missing days used to END: the partial week sat
 * until a logged-in browser happened to mount /plan or /dashboard, because
 * `DeferredMemberDrain` (the only self-heal) fires exclusively on page visits.
 * The background worker now closes its own rows and dispatches its own
 * continuation instead — this module is the pure predicate deciding WHETHER,
 * shared by the worker (and testable without it) so the rule cannot fork the
 * way the drain/engine pair once did.
 *
 * A chain must be bounded twice over, because a wide run holds the generation
 * lock for minutes and free-access mode removes the weekly spend guard:
 *   - PLAN_CHAIN_MAX_HOPS caps the invocation count outright;
 *   - progress is required (a hop that completed zero days does not chain —
 *     whatever stopped it will stop an identical successor);
 *   - the per-member attempt cap (gen_attempts, now charged by wide runs too)
 *     stops a deterministically-failing member from re-chaining via
 *     incompleteInPlanMemberIds.

/**
 * Members already IN the plan who are still missing days, and are still under
 * the per-member retry cap.
 *
 * The drain fills gaps one member at a time: `pickNextMemberId` returns a single
 * id and the run targets only them. That is right for a NEWLY ADDED member —
 * they need a skeleton, and a shared newcomer needs the whole shared group
 * rebuilt so the merged dishes line up. It is wrong for the common case after a
 * budget-trimmed run, where four or five people are each missing the same two or
 * three days: the household then needs one drain round PER MEMBER, each waiting
 * on a page visit to dispatch and each holding the generation lock, so the week
 * trickles in over five separate invocations.
 *
 * The engine has always supported the better shape — `membersToGenerate` is
 * `beneficiaries.filter((b) => !isComplete(b))` whenever no `onlyMemberId` is
 * given, so a carry-over run with no member scope fills EVERY incomplete member.
 * (Such a run skips the skeleton only when the family dish grid still covers the
 * missing days; a day the whole family lost carries no dishes, so refilling it
 * re-runs a skeleton for the short members — day-calls-only was this comment's
 * original claim and it is false for family-wide losses.)
 *
 * The list is deliberately restricted to members already in the plan. An ABSENT
 * member is a different job (skeleton + possibly a shared-group rebuild), and
 * mixing the two into one run is what `regenerateSharedGroup` exists to handle.
 *
 * "Short" is memberIsShort: the days before a mid-week join are empty by
 * design, and counting them would have this chain, the drain and the sweeper
 * refill history on every hop, visit and firing.

/**
 * Should a just-finished (success-path) meal run dispatch its own continuation?
 *
 * Every conjunct guards a specific hazard, all found the hard way:
 *   - `missingDays` empty → the week is whole, nothing to chain.
 *   - `daysCompleted === 0` → zero progress; an identical successor would meet
 *     whatever stopped this one, and "no progress → no chain" is what makes the
 *     hop cap an upper bound on WASTE, not just on invocations.
 *   - `chainDepth` at the cap → stop; the drain (page-visit) remains the
 *     last-resort absorber, now against a bounded residue.
 *   - a beneficiary ABSENT from the plan → never chain. The wide continuation
 *     carries no `regenerateSharedGroup` routing, so it would generate a shared
 *     newcomer without rebuilding the shared group — the add/drain flow owns
 *     that, and it must win the race for the lock.
 *   - nobody short is under the attempt cap → chaining would re-buy a member
 *     the cap already gave up on; the residue ships visible instead.

/**
 * A five-person household got ONE day of seven for $2.81.
 *
 * Two causes, both measured on production (plan e8476731, 11.3 min, 178,860
 * output tokens, six days lost to `Anthropic stream timeout after 202876ms`):
 *
 * 1. Phase 1 was allowed to run until 150s remained — a reserve of ONE day call.
 *    That guarantees a single day could start, not that a week can be built. It
 *    also shared `bigCallTimeoutMs` with the day loop, so the skeleton got a
 *    ceiling sized for a day of full recipes, and a ceiling is what a slow call
 *    expands to fill.
 * 2. Every timed-out call was discarded whole, including the ~25k tokens it had
 *    already written.

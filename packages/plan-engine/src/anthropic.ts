/**
 * Recover the JSON payload from a model reply.
 *
 * The fast path is a closed fence wrapping the WHOLE reply. That used to be the
 * only path, and everything else fell through to JSON.parse — which cost a whole
 * DAY of a plan each time it happened, because a SyntaxError is treated as a
 * transient content failure: the day re-rolls twice, fails, and the
 * second-chance wave re-rolls it twice more. Six full day-sized calls, then the
 * day ships EMPTY in a paid plan with nothing surfaced in the UI.
 *
 * Two real production failures (2026-07-25/26), both with perfectly good JSON
 * sitting inside the reply:
 *   - an Arabic prose preamble before the object ("أولاً سأحسب…")
 *   - a ```json fence that was opened and never closed
 *
 * So when the reply is not cleanly fenced, fall back to the outermost JSON span.
 *
 * That span is NOT always braces. The comment here used to assert "callers all
 * expect a single JSON OBJECT (day slice, skeleton, translation)" — and the
 * first two do, but BOTH translation schemas are arrays. So an unfenced
 * `[{…},{…}]` was sliced from its first `{` to its last `}`, yielding
 * `{…},{…}` — not JSON at all — and an unfenced single-element `[{…}]` became a
 * bare object that then failed the array schema. Either way the day was left
 * untranslated behind a console.warn, so whether the housekeeper got her recipes
 * came down to whether the model happened to fence that particular reply.
 *
 * Pick the bracket that actually opens the payload, and close with its match. If
 * there is no plausible JSON the text is returned unchanged and the caller's
 * parse fails exactly as it did before — this only ever widens what can be
 * recovered.

 * apiece and were discarded whole — about $2.40 of a $2.81 run, for one usable
 * day. The tokens were already paid for; most of them describe complete recipes.
 *
 * Walks the text once, tracking string/escape state so a `{` inside a recipe
 * name is not mistaken for structure, and cuts after the last complete ELEMENT
 * OF THE OUTERMOST ARRAY — the members list in a day slice, the items list in a
 * translation reply.
 *
 * That boundary matters and the first version got it wrong: it cut after the
 * last bracket that closed while merely nested, which in practice is an
 * ingredient object deep inside a half-written meal. The result is
 * structurally-valid JSON describing a meal with no steps, calories or macros —
 * which then fails the schema, so the WHOLE rescue returned null and the day was
 * lost anyway. Cutting at element boundaries means every element that survives
 * is whole by construction.
 *
 * Returns null when nothing whole made it out, so the caller fails exactly as it
 * did before.
 *
 * Deliberately generic: it makes no assumption about the shape, so it works on
 * the terse day slice, the skeleton, and the translation arrays alike. The
 * CALLER decides whether what survived is worth keeping — this only refuses to
 * throw away tokens that already describe finished work.

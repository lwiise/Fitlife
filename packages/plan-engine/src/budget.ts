 * `bigCallTimeoutMs` allows 400s for one 6-member day call, `CONTENT_MAX_RETRIES`
 * adds two more full calls per day, `MAX_RETRIES` adds five API retries with
 * sleeps, and generate.ts runs a second-chance wave over failed days). None of
 * them knew about the 15-minute ceiling the Netlify background function actually
 * runs under, so a large household could legitimately spend 20 minutes of work
 * inside a 15-minute box and be hard-killed mid-flight — no catch, no terminal
 * row, no plan.
 *
 * Measured in production on a paid `family` account: a 6-member run reached 6/7
 * days and a 4-member run 4/7 days, both killed, both recording $0.
 *
 * The fix is NOT to fit more work into one invocation. It is to stop cleanly
 * while budget remains and hand back a partial week — `DeferredMemberDrain`
 * (apps/app/src/app/plan/page.tsx) already re-dispatches for members with
 * missing days, so a trimmed run self-completes across invocations and any
 * household size works by construction.
